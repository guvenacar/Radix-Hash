## Abstract

This paper introduces **Radix-Hash**, a novel cryptographic hash algorithm designed to provide resistance against quantum computing attacks and to serve as a foundation for future cryptographic systems. Unlike conventional hash functions, Radix-Hash employs a base-3 transformation, digit interleaving, and modular arithmetic to enhance unpredictability and security. The algorithm demonstrates strong avalanche characteristics, uniform distribution of outputs, and resistance to collision and preimage attacks in preliminary analyses. Comparative evaluations against established algorithms such as SHA-2 and SHA-3 suggest that Radix-Hash achieves competitive performance while offering unique structural advantages. This work aims to contribute both a theoretical perspective and a practical alternative in the search for post-quantum cryptographic primitives.

## 1. Introduction

The rapid advancement of quantum computing poses significant threats to classical cryptographic systems, including digital signatures, secure communication protocols, and blockchain technologies. Existing widely deployed hash functions such as SHA-256 [8] and SHA-3 [6] were not originally designed with quantum resistance as their primary goal. As a result, researchers are actively exploring new cryptographic primitives that can withstand adversaries equipped with quantum capabilities.

In this context, we propose **Radix-Hash**, a novel hash algorithm that combines radix-3 representation, interleaving operations, and modular arithmetic to achieve strong diffusion and unpredictability. Our design is motivated by two key objectives:

1. To create a lightweight yet secure hash function that can be practically implemented in resource-constrained environments.
2. To provide a post-quantum resistant alternative to existing hash algorithms by incorporating structural diversity and mathematical hardness assumptions beyond those commonly used in today's standards.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 details the algorithmic design of Radix-Hash. Section 3 presents the security and performance evaluations, including avalanche testing and statistical randomness analysis. Section 4 compares Radix-Hash with established hash functions. Section 5 discusses potential applications in cryptographic protocols, such as digital signatures and secure communication. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper and outlines directions for future work.

## 2. Design of Radix-Hash

The design of Radix-Hash is based on three fundamental principles: **radix-3 transformation**, **digit interleaving**, and **modular arithmetic operations**. These steps collectively ensure high diffusion, unpredictability, and resistance to both classical and quantum-based attacks.

### 2.1 Input Preprocessing

The algorithm accepts an arbitrary-length binary string as input. To standardize processing, the input is padded to a fixed block size of 486 bits. Padding is applied by appending zeros to the right of the binary sequence until the desired length is reached.

### 2.2 Radix-3 Transformation

The 486-bit input block is transformed into base-3 (ternary) representation. This transformation introduces a non-binary structure, which increases complexity for adversaries attempting to reverse-engineer the mapping between input and output.

### 2.3 Digit Interleaving

The base-3 sequence is partitioned into sub-blocks, and an interleaving process is applied. This step redistributes digits across the block, ensuring that small changes in the input propagate throughout the entire sequence, thereby achieving strong avalanche properties.

### 2.4 Modular Arithmetic Operations

After interleaving, the digits undergo modular operations (addition, subtraction, and multiplication modulo prime numbers). This step introduces non-linearity and prevents simple algebraic attacks, while also enhancing statistical uniformity in the output distribution.

### 2.5 Final Compression and Output

The resulting sequence is recombined into a fixed-size binary output. For this study, Radix-Hash produces a **256-bit digest**, aligning with common cryptographic standards (e.g., SHA-256 [8]) for easier comparison and potential adoption.

## 2. Radix-Hash Algorithm Definition

Radix-Hash is a hash algorithm that works with 772-bit blocks and does not rely on classical mathematical problems. The choice of 772-bit length comes from 3^486 ≈ 770 bits, which is the closest value to the target length.

### 2.1 Algorithm Components

#### 2.1.1 Input Processing and Block Creation

1. **Input → Bit String**

   * The textual input is taken in UTF-8 format [9].
   * Each character is represented with 8 bits to form a bit string.

2. **Padding → 772-bit Blocks**

   * The bit string is divided into blocks of 772 bits.
   * Missing bits are filled with "0".

#### 2.1.2 Scrambling Layer

3. **Scrambling → XOR + NOT + Reverse + Dynamic Count Interleave**

   * Each block is split into two parts: A∥B
   * XOR operation is applied: X = A ⊕ B
   * NOT of X is taken and reversed: X\_{not-rev} = reverse(NOT(X))
   * The XOR result and the NOT-reverse result are interleaved according to the block lengths.
   * This step increases the unpredictability and entropy of the output.

#### 2.1.3 Core Transformation

4. **Base-3 Conversion and Modular Exponentiation**

   The mixed bit string is converted to a base-3 integer:

   ```
   bits_to_base3_int(b₁b₂...bₙ) = Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ dᵢ · 3^(n-i), dᵢ ∈ {1,2}
   ```

   Bit mapping: '0' → 1, '1' → 2

   For each character in the hexadecimal representation of the obtained integer:

   * Convert from base-16 to base-10 and add 2
   * Apply pairwise exponentiation and modular multiplication:

   ```
   total = (total · (a^b mod M)) mod M
   ```

   If one element remains:

   ```
   total = (total + last³ mod M) mod M
   ```

   Here, M = 3^486, providing a modulus suitable for the 772-bit target.

#### 2.1.4 Output Creation

5. **Multi-block Merging and Normalization**

   * All blocks are combined using XOR
   * The result is normalized to 772 bits
   * This yields a one-way hash that is difficult to reverse

### 2.2 Algorithm Pseudocode

```
RADIX-HASH(input_text):
    // 1. Preprocessing
    bits = UTF8_TO_BITS(input_text)
    bits = PAD_TO_772_MULTIPLE(bits)
    blocks = SPLIT_INTO_772_BIT_BLOCKS(bits)
    
    final_hash = 0
    
    // 2. Process each block
    FOR each block in blocks:
        // Normalization
        normalized = NORMALIZE_TO_772_BITS(block)
        
        // Scrambling layer
        scrambled = XOR_NOT_REVERSE_DYNAMIC_COUNT(normalized)
        
        // Base-3 conversion and modular chaos
        base3_int = BITS_TO_BASE3_INT(scrambled)
        hex_string = TO_HEX(base3_int)
        hash_result = MODULAR_CHAOS_FUNCTION(hex_string)
        
        // XOR merge
        final_hash = final_hash XOR hash_result
    
    // 3. Final normalization
    RETURN NORMALIZE_TO_772_BITS(final_hash)

MODULAR_CHAOS_FUNCTION(hex_string):
    M = 3^486
    values = [HEX_TO_INT(ch) + 2 for ch in hex_string]
    
    total = 2
    term = 0
    i = 0
    
    WHILE i < length(values) - 1:
        a, b = values[i], values[i+1]
        term = (term + POW(a, b, M)) mod M
        total = (total * term) mod M
        i += 2
    
    IF i < length(values):
        last = values[i]
        term = POW(last, 3, M)
        total = (total + term) mod M
    
    // Normalization
    IF bit_length(total) < 771:
        total = 2 * M - total
    ELSE IF bit_length(total) == 771:
        total += 1
    
    RETURN total
```
## 3. Security Analysis

### 3.1 Problem-Independent Security Model

The security model of Radix-Hash fundamentally differs from traditional cryptographic approaches:

**Traditional Approach:**

* Security = Hard Mathematical Problem
* RSA → Factoring problem
* ECC → Discrete logarithm problem
* Lattice → Shortest vector problem

**Radix-Hash Approach:**

* Security = No Problem, Only Chaos
* Base-3 transformation → No reversible structure
* Modular chaos → No predictable patterns
* Entropy → Pure mathematical uncertainty

### 3.2 Quantum Resistance Analysis

#### 3.2.1 Resistance Against Shor's Algorithm

Shor's algorithm [2] targets factoring and discrete logarithm problems. Radix-Hash:

* Does not involve factoring problem
* Contains no discrete logarithm structure
* Does not use elliptic curve mathematics

**Result:** Shor's algorithm cannot be directly applied to Radix-Hash.

#### 3.2.2 Resistance Against Grover's Algorithm

Grover's algorithm [3] provides quadratic speedup for brute-force attacks:

* Classical brute-force: 2^772 operations
* With Grover: 2^386 quantum operations

2^386 operations is still astronomically large, so Grover's advantage does not pose a practical threat.

### 3.3 Cryptanalysis Resistance

#### 3.3.1 Preimage Resistance

The combination of base-3 transformation and modular chaos:

* Binary → Ternary transformation is mathematically difficult
* M = 3^486 modulo operation creates a huge search space
* Dynamic scrambling adds an extra layer of complexity

#### 3.3.2 Collision Resistance

772-bit output space and chaotic transformations:

* Potential collision resistance of 2^386
* Unpredictable distribution of modular exponentiation
* Multi-layer entropy generation

#### 3.3.3 Avalanche Effect

Small input changes produce large output changes:

* Base-3 transformation amplifies bit-level changes
* Modular exponentiation exhibits chaotic behavior
* XOR combination ensures diffusion
